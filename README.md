# PaperRAG â€“ Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Scientific Papers

PaperRAG is a lightweight, modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for question-answering over scientific documents. The system uses FAISS for semantic retrieval and Groq-hosted LLaMA-3 for generating grounded, context-aware responses. It supports multi-document processing, page-level source attribution, and multi-turn chat interactions.
